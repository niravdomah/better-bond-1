# Epic 1: Dashboard

## Description

Implements the Dashboard screen — the home page of the BetterBond Commission Payments POC. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance summary of commission payment activity segmented by agency, including bar charts, metric value cards, a parked payments aging report, and a clickable agency summary grid. All metric components update dynamically when an agency is selected.
