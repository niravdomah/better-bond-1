Starting the TDD workflow. Let me first check for feature specs and initialize the workflow state.

Good, I found the feature spec. Let me read it along with the API definition and dataset.

The spec is very large. Let me read the beginning to understand its structure, and also read the API definition and dataset separately.

Good. Now I have a complete picture of the spec. This feature involves **3 UI screens** with significant functionality. Let me initialize the workflow state and ask about wireframes.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

I found the feature spec: **BetterBond Commission Payments POC**. Here's a summary:

**3 Primary Screens:**
1. **Dashboard Screen** - At-a-glance summary with bar charts (payments ready, parked payments), value totals, aging report, and an agency summary grid
2. **Payment Management Screen** - Operational hub per agency with main grid, parking/unparking payments, bulk operations, initiate payment, and invoice generation
3. **Payments Made Screen** - Processed payments view with invoice download links

**Backend API:** An OpenAPI spec exists at `documentation/Api Definition.yaml` pointing to `http://localhost:8042` with endpoints for payments, payment batches, dashboard, park/unpark, and invoice PDF download.

**Sample Data:** A full dataset with 10 agencies, 50 agents, and ~160 payments in various states (READY, PARKED, PROCESSED).

---

This feature involves **multiple UI screens with interactive components** (charts, grids, modals, search). Would you like me to create wireframes first using the **ui-ux-designer** agent, or proceed directly to scoping (defining epics)?

Task: Create wireframes for UI screens

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The ui-ux-designer agent has identified the following **3 screens** for wireframing:

1. **Dashboard Screen** - Summary view with bar charts (payments ready, parked), value cards, aging report graph, and agency summary grid
2. **Payment Management Screen** - Per-agency operational hub with main grid, parked grid, search/filter, park/unpark actions, bulk operations, and initiate payment flow
3. **Payments Made Screen** - Processed payments grid with invoice download links and search

Do you approve this screen list to proceed with wireframe creation?

Here are the wireframes for your review:

---

**Screen 1: Dashboard** - 6 metric components (2 bar charts, 3 value cards, aging report) in a 2-column grid layout, plus an agency summary data grid with [Manage] buttons that navigate to Screen 2.

**Screen 2: Payment Management** - Main grid with checkboxes, per-row [Park] buttons, search bar, and [Initiate Payment for All]. Parked grid below with [Unpark] controls. Includes 5 modals: Park Single, Park Multiple, Unpark, Initiate Payment Confirmation, and Payment Processed Success.

**Screen 3: Payments Made** - Paginated grid showing processed payment batches per agency with [PDF] invoice download links. Includes a sample invoice layout reference.

**Design notes:** Agency dropdown in the header provides persistent context switching across all screens. Back to Dashboard link on Screen 2. Success modal links to Screen 3.
