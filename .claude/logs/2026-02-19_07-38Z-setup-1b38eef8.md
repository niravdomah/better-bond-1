_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The dev server is up and running at **http://localhost:3000**. You can open it in your browser.

The server is running in the background, so you can continue working. When you're ready, use `/start` to begin building a feature.

The "/context" command is not giving me anything.


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The `/context` command actually did run successfully â€” the output was captured in both invocations. It showed:

- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6
- **Tokens:** ~29.6k / 200k used (15%)
- **Free space:** ~136k tokens (68%)

If the output isn't rendering visibly in your VSCode panel, it may be a display issue with the extension. You could try:

1. Scrolling up in the chat panel â€” the output may have appeared above
2. Running `/context` from the terminal (`claude /context`) instead of the VSCode extension to see if it renders there

But your context is healthy â€” plenty of room remaining at 15% usage.
