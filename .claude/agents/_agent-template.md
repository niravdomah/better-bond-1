# Agent Name

**Role:** [PHASE] phase - Brief description of role in workflow

## Agent Startup

**First action when starting work** (before any other steps):

```bash
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --mark-started
```

This marks the current phase as "in_progress" for accurate status reporting.

### Initialize Progress Display

After marking the phase as started, generate and display the workflow progress list:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/generate-todo-list.js
```

Parse the JSON output and call `TodoWrite` with the resulting array. Then add your agent sub-tasks after the item with `status: "in_progress"`. Prefix sub-task content with `"    >> "` to distinguish from workflow items.

**Your sub-tasks** (provide both `content` and `activeForm` for each):
- `content`: what to do — shown when pending or completed (e.g. "Run quality gates")
- `activeForm`: what's happening — shown while in progress (e.g. "Running quality gates")

1. `{ content: "    >> [First step description]", activeForm: "[First step]-ing..." }`
2. `{ content: "    >> [Second step description]", activeForm: "[Second step]-ing..." }`
3. `{ content: "    >> [Third step description]", activeForm: "[Third step]-ing..." }`

Start all sub-tasks as `"pending"`. As you progress, mark the current sub-task as `"in_progress"` and completed ones as `"completed"`. Re-run `generate-todo-list.js` before each TodoWrite call to get the current base list, then merge in your updated sub-tasks.

After completing your work and running the transition script, call `generate-todo-list.js` one final time and update TodoWrite with just the base list (no agent sub-tasks).

## Workflow Position

```
feature-planner → test-generator → developer → code-reviewer
     SCOPE/STORIES     WRITE-TESTS     IMPLEMENT      QA
                                          ↑
                                     YOU ARE HERE
```

## Purpose

[2-3 sentences describing what this agent does and why it exists]

---

## When to Use

- [Scenario 1 when this agent should be invoked]
- [Scenario 2]
- [Scenario 3]

**Don't use:**
- [Scenario when NOT to use this agent]
- [Another scenario]

---

## Input/Output

**Input:**
- [What files/context this agent reads]
- [Expected state before running]

**Output:**
- [What files this agent creates/modifies]
- [Context files written to `generated-docs/context/`]

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: [First Step Name]

[Description of what to do]

```bash
# Example command if applicable
```

### Step 2: [Second Step Name]

[Description]

### Step N: [Final Step Name]

[Description]

---

## Guidelines

### DO:
- [Best practice 1]
- [Best practice 2]
- [Best practice 3]

### DON'T:
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]
- [Anti-pattern 3]

### CRITICAL: No Error Suppressions Allowed

**NEVER use error suppression directives.** This is a strict policy.

**Forbidden suppressions:**
- `// eslint-disable`
- `// eslint-disable-next-line`
- `// @ts-expect-error`
- `// @ts-ignore`
- `// @ts-nocheck`

If you encounter an error, fix it properly. Do not suppress it.

---

## Update Workflow State

After completing your work, **you MUST update the workflow state** using the transition script:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --current --to [NEXT_PHASE] --verify-output
```

### Script Execution Verification (CRITICAL)

**You MUST verify the script succeeded:**

1. Check the JSON output contains `"status": "ok"`
2. If `"status": "error"`, **STOP** and report the error to the user
3. Do NOT proceed to the next phase if the transition failed

Example success output:
```json
{ "status": "ok", "message": "Transitioned Epic 1 from [CURRENT] to [NEXT]" }
```

---

## Commit and Push

Before completing, commit all artifacts:

```bash
git add [files] .claude/logs/
git commit -m "[PHASE]: [Description of what was done]"
git push origin main
```

**Always include `.claude/logs` in every commit** - this provides traceability of Claude's actions.

---

## Completion

Return a concise summary to the orchestrator:

```
[PHASE] complete for Epic [N], Story [M]: [Name]. [Key metric]. Ready for [NEXT_PHASE].
```

The orchestrator manages context-clearing boundaries and phase transitions. Agents do not need to instruct the orchestrator about context clearing.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
- [ ] **Workflow state updated** via transition script
- [ ] **Artifacts committed and pushed**
