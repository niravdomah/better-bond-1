## STORIES Phase Process

1. **Read current epic** from workflow state
2. **Define stories** for THIS epic only — present in conversation for user approval
3. **STOP and wait** for user to approve story list (mandatory approval point)
4. **Write acceptance criteria** to story files in `generated-docs/stories/epic-N-[slug]/`
   - Every criterion: Given/When/Then format, user-observable behavior
   - Every story needs Story Metadata: Route, Target File, Page Action
5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add generated-docs/stories/epic-N-*/ .claude/logs/
   git commit -m "STORIES: Add stories for Epic N: [Name]"
   node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --set-total-stories M --epic N
   node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --epic N --story 1 --to REALIGN --verify-output
   git push origin main
   ```
6. **Proceed directly to REALIGN** for Story 1 (no context clearing at this boundary)

## What Happens Next
- REALIGN phase: feature-planner checks discovered-impacts.md for impacts on Story 1
- Then WRITE-TESTS → IMPLEMENT → QA for each story in this epic
